I’m a Frontend Product Engineer with 5+ years of professional experience building reliable, user-focused web applications used in real production environments.

For the past several years, I’ve played a key role in the long-term development of a medical staffing platform operating across South Africa and the UK, with ongoing expansion into the US market. My work focuses on translating product requirements into clean, scalable frontend solutions within mature codebases.

I specialize in owning frontend features end-to-end, from implementation to long-term maintainability. This includes building and maintaining internal UI libraries, complex React hooks, WYSIWYG editors, and developer tooling that improves both user experience and developer productivity.

What I bring to a project

- Strong execution within existing systems and large codebases
- Product-focused frontend development with attention to UX, performance, and edge cases
- Clean, maintainable code with a long-term mindset
- Clear communication and proactive collaboration in distributed teams

Core technical strengths:

- React (hooks, advanced state patterns, monorepos)
- TypeScript & JavaScript
- UI systems: Tailwind CSS, Storybook, custom component libraries
- Build & tooling: Vite, Webpack, Node scripting
- Testing: Jest, Vitest
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions, project scaffolding, deployments
- Architecture: modular frontend systems, internal APIs
- Version control & package management: Git, pnpm, npm, yarn

Beyond implementation, I’ve contributed to setting frontend standards, writing technical specs, mentoring junior developers, and improving team workflows. I’m highly organized and often support projects with documentation, proposal preparation, and clear technical communication.

If you’re looking for a frontend engineer who can step into your product, understand it quickly, and ship reliably without hand-holding, I’d be happy to help.
