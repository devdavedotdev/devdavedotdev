## 👋 Hi, I'm David — Frontend Product Engineer (React, TypeScript)

I'm a Frontend Product Engineer with 5+ years of professional experience building and maintaining user-facing web applications in production environments. I work primarily with React-based stacks and focus on shipping reliable, scalable frontend features that support real business and user needs.

I've spent several years contributing to long-running products, working within mature codebases, and translating product requirements into clean, maintainable frontend solutions. My work typically involves owning features end-to-end on the frontend, improving UI systems, handling complex state and edge cases, and collaborating closely with product and design teams.

I'm comfortable working independently, value clarity in communication, and take responsibility for the quality and longevity of the code I ship.
