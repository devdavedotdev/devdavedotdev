# Hello! :octocat:


## 👋 Hi, I'm David, Web & AI Product Engineer (React, TypeScript)

I'm a Web & AI Product Engineer with 5+ years of professional experience building web applications and AI-powered products in production environments.

I build AI systems: multi-provider chat platforms supporting multiple models from various providers, vision/multimodal applications, and image generation tools (DALL-E 3, Flux). I've shipped streaming chat interfaces, provider abstraction layers, and cost-optimized AI workflows using Vercel AI SDK and OpenRouter.

I've spent several years contributing to long-running products, working within mature codebases, and translating product requirements into clean, maintainable solutions. I'm comfortable working independently and take responsibility for the quality of my code.

## 🧠 Engineering Approach

- **Build with clarity** – Code should be easy to reason about, modify, and extend
- **Own features end-to-end** – From implementation to long-term maintainability
- **AI-first thinking** – Integrate AI capabilities where they add real value
- **Product-focused** – Align technical decisions with business needs and user impact
- **Work within systems** – Comfortable in mature codebases and existing architectures
